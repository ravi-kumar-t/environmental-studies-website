            <h1>What is an endangered species?</h1>
            <p>An endangered species is a species that is very likely to become extinct in the near future, either worldwide or within a specific region. Endangered species may be at risk due to factors such as habitat loss, poaching or other invasive species, like humans.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="detail">
            <h1>Why is endangered species conservation important?</h1>
            <p>Healthy ecosystems mean a healthy world. <br> 
                There are many reasons why a species might go extinct. Habitat loss, overexploitation, poaching, and pollution being just a few reasons that more and more animal species are critically endangered – threatening the health of ecosystems around the world. But this biodiversity loss isn’t just about losing beautiful, essential animal species that make the world a more diverse, magical place. It affects us too: biodiversity protects all ecosystems, including the ones we live in. Without this balance, climate change will become worse, diseases will spread faster, and our food security will be threatened. It’s essential for our survival – and the survival of all life on planet earth – that we protect and restore our natural environments to secure the future of every species, including our own.</p>

            <h1>Why should we save endangered species.</h1>
            <p>Plants and animals maintain the health of an ecosystem. When a species becomes endangered, its a sign that an ecosystem is out of balance. And the consequences can be critical. <br>
                Ecosystems are groups of plants and animals that are found in the same area and interact with each other. These interactions make up and maintain the environments we know today like rainforests, mountains and savannahs. <br>
                But the balance within an ecosystem isnt always easy to maintain; the loss of one species often triggers the loss of others. For example, when grey wolves were hunted to near-extinction in the United States Yellowstone National Park, the beaver population also decreased significantly. <br>
                This happened because the elk population, which are usually hunted by wolves, were able to graze freely and more heavily on the plants that were also needed by beavers to survive during winter.</p>
            </div>
        <div class="detail">
            <h1>How can we conserve endangered species?</h1>
            <p>Theres no single or set way to do it. endangered species conservation is vital work, and its full of variety, opportunity and adventure. <br>
                At Eco Earth, most of our work is done through volunteer conservation projects, including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Wildlife conservation volunteering</b></li>
                    <li><b>Endangered Species Monitoring</b></li>
                    <li><b>Species census</b></li>
                    <li><b>Collect and record data</b></li>
                    <li><b>Camera trapping</b></li>
                    <li><b>Habitat restoration</b></li>
                    <li><b>Environmental education</b></li>
                    <li><b>Field guide training</b></li>
                    <li><b>Community outreach</b></li>
                    <li><b>Social awareness</b></li>
                </ul>
                
        </div>
        <div class="detail">
            <h1>How to contribute towards the conservation of endangered species</h1>
            <p>Governments, non-profit organisations, international organisations, local communities and individuals are working together to contribute towards growing the populations of endangered species. <br>
                They are also building on awareness campaigns that are aimed at getting more people involved in vital conservation work.<br>            
                You can make an impact by learning and raising awareness about endangered species in your area and across the world. A sustainable 
                way to do this is to get involved as a volunteer and partner with governments and organisations  like Eco Earth  on existing marine or wildlife conservation projects.<br>
                This is a great way to learn about wildlife conservation, and gain hands-on, professional field experience. These practical skills will boost your resume for a career in sustainable development.
                 And if you have a different career in mind, you will still pick up other valuable skills like teamwork and leadership.

                    <h3>Endangered Species Conservation</h3>
                    <p>Endangered species are a global concern, as countless animals and plants face the 
                        threat of extinction due to habitat loss, hunting, climate change, and other human activities.
                         There are also many success stories of species that have recovered from the brink of extinction. <br>
                         In this article, we will explore some of the success stories of endangered species that have recovered and 
                         what we can learn from them.</p>

                    <h3>Forest Conservation and Rehabilitation</h3>
                    <p>Forest conservation is essential for protecting endangered species. 
                        Forests provide habitat for a wide variety of plants and animals, 
                        many of which are found nowhere else on Earth. When forests are destroyed, 
                        these species lose their homes and food sources, and they are at increased risk of extinction.</p>

                    <h3>Endangered Species Monitoring</h3>
                    <p>Monitoring endangered species is essential for understanding their populations and the threats 
                        they face. Our endangered species monitoring program works to collect data on endangered species
                         and their habitats, helping to inform conservation efforts and protect these vulnerable creatures.
                          Join us in this critical effort to safeguard the future of our planet's most endangered animals.</p>
